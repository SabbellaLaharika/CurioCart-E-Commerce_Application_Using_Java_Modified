## Features

* Product/category organization using folders for sample data and assets.
* Java source code and resources stored under `codes/`.
* Demo video included to showcase the app flow.
* Designed to be run from an IDE or built with a Java build tool if present.

## Requirements and setup (high level)

* Java JDK (8, 11 or newer recommended).
* If the repo contains a `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` use Maven/Gradle; otherwise open in an IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) and run the main class or built JAR.
* To run: open the project in your IDE, compile the code, and run the application entry point. If a runnable JAR is provided, use `java -jar <name>.jar`.

## Notes & demo link

The repository includes a demo video and a published demo link (see repo for the “view output” link). Use that link to preview the project output as posted by the author. ([GitHub][1])

## Possible improvements / next steps

* Add an explicit build instruction (Maven/Gradle commands) or a runnable jar.
* Provide a short start script or README steps that include which Java class to run.
* Add license and CONTRIBUTING files.

## Contributing

Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and open a pull request. Please document any changes to the folder layout in the README.

## License & disclaimer

Add a LICENSE (MIT recommended) if you want public reuse. This repo appears educational/demo-focused — for a production e-commerce system, add security, persistence, and payment handling.
